# Bridging-Theory-and-Experiment-Quantum-Simulation-of-Spin-Chains-and-Vertex-Models
To implement and compare quantum simulations of these integrable models on two cutting-edge quantum computing platforms:  IonQ's trapped-ion quantum processor for the Heisenberg spin chain, and QuEra's neutral atom processor for the Six-Vertex model.
